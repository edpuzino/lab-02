function**
  * implement the `.length` property
  * implement the following methods on the list constructor
    * `push()`
    * `pop()`
    * `shift()`
    * `unshift()`
    * `splice()`
    * `slice()`
  * Do not use any built-in array methods to do this

  * **Re-Implement using a Class definition**
    * Do this after your tests are completed.
    * Note, that this should be a refactor, so your tests should remain unchanged and green once your re-implementation is completed
  
###### Testing
* tests that ensure the list module functions correctly with error-check parameters
* tests that the correct errors are thrown with invalid arguments exist
* tests to ensure that the list module functions return the correct results when invoked with valid arguments


##  Documentation
Include your travis badge at the top of your `README.md` file
In your `README.md`, describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and it's behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to add any additional information in your `README.md` that you would like.
