##  Documentation
* I have three categories, vehicles, flying vehicles, and sea creatures.  
* Each of the categories are built using three different methods, class, constructor, and factory.
* The tests will test all of the code seperately.
* All of the tests ar set up for the class method, which can be changed to either constructor or factory by commenting out class and uncommenting the other methods on the index.js page and the appropriate test page for vehicle, flying vehicle, or sea creature.
